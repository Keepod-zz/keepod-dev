Guide to Keepod OS development
===========

Keepod OS includes many open source projects. If you are not sure which project to join, or what projects are available, this guide will help you.

Keepod-dev will be updated monthly to show the current status of all Keepod projects. There is no code here, only documents and references to other projects. 

If you had any question, please create an issue.
